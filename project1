#created a quest wifi on my router.

- I took my default gateway and paste it onto google and it requested a username and a password.
 So I put that in and loged in into the router .

- I went to the quest page and create a quest internet by enable guest internet, created a ssid name for the guest,
I didn't allow the quest to be able to acess my local network. 

I used  WPA2-PSK [AES] as the security type, so I enetered a strong password and it encrypts using AES.


I test this by connecting to the quest wifi and when I try to connect to local devices that's connected on the main
wifi it wasn't showing.
