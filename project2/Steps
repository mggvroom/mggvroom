## Steps on how I was able to crack all those password.


1. So I first did a wget for rockyou.txt and a list of
 500_password.txt

2. After that I creates a scipt that view the content of 
500_passwords.txt and hash it using md5sum, also putting the
first line only into a file alled password.

3. I use hashcat to crack those hashes but at the end it
said exhausted, but when i did a --show I could see every
hashes and thier password. Whenever I only cracked one hash 
it showed cracked and it shows the hash and its password
but when it was 200 hashes it showed exhuast but with
--show I was able to see all the hashes and passwword.  



$ hashcat -m 0 password 500_password
