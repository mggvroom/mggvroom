## cracking a user password.


1. So I created a username and put a weak password.

2. I went into /etc/shadow for the user hash password
and /etc/passwd for the user info. I copied each of 
those and put into seperate files.


3. I merge both file together into a file called shadow.txt. I
also created a file with some password wich also include that
user password i'm trying to crack. Then I use john the ripper to
crack the passowrd and it work.




Code : john --wordlist=password.txt --format=crypt shadow.txt


Kammo@MGGVroom:~/Resume_project/project3$ john --wordlist=password.txt --format=crypt shadow.txt

Loaded 1 password hash (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])
